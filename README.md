# Doc-GPT

Spell the magic of GPT in long pdfs & docs? Needed to copy paste the whole content? Hereâ€™s the solution you wanted!

Ever thought if you could simply share a whole document itself & ask your question based on the pdf content directly to interact with a GPT model like "chat GPT" ? Most of us might have encountered this & have always ended up manually copying and pasting content from PDFs. This is the problem DOC-GPT tries to solve. The process of extracting information from PDF documents and responding to questions related to their content can be simplified & users can seamlessly upload PDF files directly to the platform, eliminating the need for manual content extraction.

# How it Works

PDFs or Doc files can be directly uploaded in the space provided & the question to be inferred from the doc content can be typed,this saves the manual task of copying and pasting the entire content rom the doc in chat-gpt. On submission the answer will be provided based on the content in the uploaded file. Basically, a very useful "chat GPT plugin" that simplifies interactions with the GPT model for querying PDF content.
